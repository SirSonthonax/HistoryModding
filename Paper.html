	<h1>Background</h1>
	
	<h3>Motivation</h3>	
	<p>This project was started with three seperate goals in mind. First of all, it was an excercise in working with a more rigid planning. I usually just work on a task untill it feels 'finished',
	which often results in tasks later in the project getting less time than tasks earlier in the project. In this case, a X number of hours was alloted for each
	task, and when X hours were reached, the task was rounded off.</p>
	
	<p>Secondly, it was an excercise in working with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The goal was to get a better feeling for the way the web works by building a small website myself. The main challenge
	encountered was actually this page, not the main page with the list. Formatting a large amount of text to be somewhat readable proved challenging in HTML, and the references were hard to code.</p>
	
	<p>Finally, this project was an excercise in thinking about history. Specifically, it was about the way history can be represented, and even more specifically, how it is represented in
	Sid Meier's Civilization VI. Thinking about the way history is communicated through a game like Civilization by looking at the way mods use and represent history was fun. But it was a challenge
	to create a list that communicated my thoughts about it, while still being easy in use. The original version of the list was much heavier, with longer reviews for each mod. It was heavily trimmed down
	to make it easier to see if a mod is suitable. Considering the audience of your work in such a way was a new and interesting experience as well.</p>
	
	<h3>Thoughts on Civilization and Mods</h3>
	<p>The <i>Sid Meier’s Civilization</i> series is an immensely popular series of videogames for the PC. At the time of writing (March 15th 2018) both the fifth instalment of the
	series and the sixth instalment in the series feature in the top sellers list of the online Steam store. The fact that Civilization V features on the top 15 
	of bestselling games 8 years after release is truly remarkable.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> 
	In short, the game is about ‘building an empire to stand the test of time’ <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> The player achieves this by choosing a civilization, 
	such as 
	the English, Scythians or Aztecs, and guiding them through history. At the center of gameplay is the 4X-genre that Civilization pioneered. 4X stands for eXplore, eXpand, eXploit 
	and eXterminate. The game asks the player to explore the map and tree of technologies, to expand the reach of its Civilization, to exploit resources and to exterminate 
	any threats. Taken together, these elements form a game that is a very rough mirror of history, albeit one where Enrico Dandolo might be waging nuclear war against Theodore 
	Roosevelt for control of the pyramids.</p>
	
	<p>The idea of using a videogame to communicate truths has long seemed like an impossibility to many historians, but some scholars have recently started to embrace the idea.
	It has been argued that the greatest strength of historical video games is to represent history as a process. By giving a player agency in historical events, it teaches the 
	player about cause and effect.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> Civilization is one the most prominent examples of this type of game. As a result, it has already been 
	used in education. In an article in The Social Studies, J. Pagnotti and W. Russel outline a lesson plan 
	that they have used in the past to use Civilization IV in high schools.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> A. Chapman has written about instances where the 
	series was used to explore the ideas of specific books that talk about similar themes, such as Kennedy’s <i>The Rise and Fall of Great Powers</I> and Huntingtons 
	<i>The Clash of Civilizations</i>. In this way, intertextual historical narrative is created that is useful for teaching.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>	
	</p>
	
	<p>Despite the upsides of games like civilization, there are some critics that deem Civilization inappropriate for conveying historical information. 
	Both professional game critics and a variety of scholars have pointed out weaknesses and misrepresentations within the narrative as presented by the games. 
	These weaknesses are more structural than the above example of Theodore Roosevelt fighting Enrico Dandolo, because they focus not so much on the strange scenarios 
	that emerge during gameplay. Instead, the focus on the building blocks of the narrative, the elements included by the game developers. These elements decide what 
	strange narratives can arise in the first place, and determine the parts and form of history the player is exposed to. A good example is given by A. A. Mol, Aris 
	Politopoulos and Csilla E. Ariese-Vandemeulebroucke in their article on history and heritage in the game series. They argue that the wonders available in Civilization 
	(special buildings or natural phenomena that can only occur once in every playthrough of the game) are slanted towards particular cultures. The USA, for example, is very
	much overrepresented.<a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></p>
	
	<p>Originally, the designer of the first game in the series intended to keep politics as far away from the series as possible.<a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a> Many critics 
	have argued that this strategy is not viable anymore. A game series focused on the history of human civilization will always have certain political implications. After 
	the release of the first expansion to Civilization VI, called Rise and Fall, Alister McQuarry criticized the fact that Civilization is ‘all rise and no fall’<a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a>  , presenting 
	an overly optimistic view of history. The expansion also added the new civilization of the Cree to the game. The headman of the Cree came forward not long after the new
	civilization was announced. He reached out to the game developers to criticize the way his people were portrayed. He complained that the game reinforced the idea that the
	Cree people had the same mindset as the European Settlers.<a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a> This echoes a commonly heard sentiment about the game: not matter who you start out
	as, your civilization will eventually end up looking like modern day America.<a href="#fn9" id="ref10">10</a></p>
	
	<p>Many of these criticisms seem to center around the fact that Civilization series claims to be apolitical, but nonetheless expresses certain political ideologies by 
	the options it offers to the player. The game is ultimately slanted to a teleological, western view. Chapman has emphasized that part of Civilization’s power is the 
	ability to make the player familiar with a ton of concepts, names and people from history.<a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a>  However, the player will mostly become familiar 
	with concepts, names and people
	that hail from the western world, or are important to their worldview.</p>
	
	<p>A number of scholars and critics have made small references to another videogame-related phenomenon that has barely been looked at, but is nonetheless related. The phenomenon in
	question is user-made modifications. Mol, Politopoulos and Ariese-Vandemeulebroucke have suggested it as a possible route of approach for the heritage-discipline.<a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a> 
	Chapman even views the active development of mods that try to make a game more accurate as a prime example of the importance of video games as an historical medium. 
	According to him, it indicates that history is just as important to these gamers as the game itself. After all, if they didn’t care about history, then why would they 
	want to alter the rules of the game to make it feel more historical? Chapman calls modders 'historical revisionists'. If historical mods for a game like
		Civilization are a way of representing history, we could subject them to the same critical inspection as the base game.<a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></p> 
	
	<p>The amount of modifications on offer in the Steam Workshop, the most
	prominent way to install mods to a game of Civilization, is staggering. It does not, however, offer a more balanced array of building blocks for the game. To illustrate, as can 
	be seen in these graphs, the origins of the mods offered in the Steam Workshop barely differ from the ones in the basegame. This doesn't quite matter though, because one of the hardest
	parts of using mods is choosing which ones to install. If someone were looking for a way to expand a particular part of the game, mods could be a solution. This list was made for people 
	who are interested in using purely historical mods to expand their game. The list mentions a quick description of the mod, a link to the Workshop. Besides this, the list
	offers some critique on both the impact on gameplay and the way the modification represents history. This way, the list aims to make it easier for players who are passionate about
	the historical aspect of their game (and I imagine there are a lot of those) to make an informed choice on what mods to add to their game.</p>
