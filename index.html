					<td>This mod adds the Ethiopian Civilization, lead by Emperor Zara Yaqob, to the game. This version of Ethiopia seems to be primarily inspired by medieval Ethiopia. As a result, it is a civilization with a heavy focus on religion and a bias towards hills and mountains.</td>

						<ul>
							<li><font color="green">The leader screen is partly animated! It is nowhere near the quality of the official leaders, but it is a good step up from static leaders.</font></li>
							<li><font color="green">The unique building and unit have unique graphical designs!</font></li>
							<li><font color="red">Zara Yaqob's ability, which can grant you up to two wildcard slots very easily, is unbalanced.</font></li>
						</ul>
					</td> 
    				<td><ul>
						<li><font color="green">Both the Rock-Hewn Church and the Shotelai-unique unit are accurately represented in the gameplay.</font></li>
						<li><font color="green">Ethiopia's unique ability 'Solomonid Dynasty', which allows them to buy settlers, builders and traders with faith, is an interesting but not completely wrong way of representing the state building that the Solomonids did based on religion.</font></li>
						<li><font color="red">Zara Yaqobs' unique ability, which awards him two extra wildcard slots after building a holy site, feels like it is coming out of nowhere. Zara Yaqob was a leader who greatly strengthened the Ethiopian church and it's relation with other Christians. A bonus to inner unity or relations with people of the same faith would feel much more appropriate and less generic.</font></li>

							<li><font color="green">The actual abilities feel a little bit generic, but the names for Pius' unique ability (Vatican Council) and agenda (Papal Infallibility) accurately represent what he worked on during his pontificate.</font></li>
