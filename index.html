		<i>Working Title, obviously</i>
	<h3>General idea</h3>
	<p>The <i>Sid Meier’s Civilization</i> series is a wildly popular videogame presenting world history to a varied audience. The idea of using a videogame to communicate
		truths has long seemed like an impossibility, but some scholars have recently started to embrace it. The greatest strength of historical videogames is to represent
		history as a process. By giving a player agency in historical events, it teaches the player about cause and effect.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Most people who have played
		the <i>Civilization</i> series might agree that this is, to some extent, the truth. However, the immensly popular series has received its fair share of criticism, both from historical scholars and
		professional game critics. Alister MacQuarrie recently criticized the fact that Civilization is ‘all rise and no fall’<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>, presenting an overly optimistic view of history. 
		Kanishk Taroor argued that Sid Meier’s ideal of making the series apolitical was impossible.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>  Others have pointed out the overrepresentation of certain continents in 
		the series’ available civilizations and wonders.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> After the recent announcement of the <i>Rise and Fall</i> expansion for Civilization VI, which included the nation of the Cree,
		the headman of the Cree reached out to the game developers to criticize the way his people were portrayed. He complained that the game reïnforced the idea that the Cree people had the same mindset as the European Settlers.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> This
		echoes a commonly heard sentiment about the game: not matter who you start out as, your civilization will eventually end up looking like modern day America.
		Some of these criticisms could only be addressed by radically reshaping some of the game-mechanics of the series. But what improvements could be made within the existing framework of the games? The series has had a very active modding community since the release of the fourth
		installment of the series. Could these modders, who theoretically do not face the problem of having to comply with studio bosses, play a part in alleviating some of these criticisms? This website offers a list of tested modifications available on the steam workshop. Each mod is evaluated on four aspects:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Accuracy</b><br>How historically acurate is the mod? Are there any truly glaring errors?</li>
				<li><b>Diversity</b><br>Does the mod expand the options offered by Civilization?</li>
				<li><b>Educational Value</b><br>Does the mod credit a source for used information? Do elements added by it have a Civipedia entry?</li>
				<li><b>Compatability</b><br>Does the mod force the user to install other mods? Does it change the game in a radical way that decreases compatability?</li>
			</ul>
